			<p>PortaPayments is a "Scan & Pay" solution which allows customers to purchase your goods by scanning a 3D bar code with their 'phone. We provide two types of codes, one is free and requires the use of our application to scan and pay, the other, called a universal code, has a very small charge associated with it and will work with any QR code scanner that can scan and direct users to website URLs.</p>

				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p>PortaPayments allows you to generate a bar code which can be scanned by a mobile 'phone application in order to make the payment. The application allows you
				to create and scan PortaPayments codes and a payment can be made between two people in five simple steps;</p>
				<p>Step 1 - The payment recipient generates a payment code. (You can do this either using the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.portapayments.android">Android application</a> or using the <a href="index.html">code generator</a> on this website)</p>
				<p>Step 2 - The payment sender scans the payment code. (Using our <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.portapayments.android">Android application</a> for free codes, or any QR code scanner for the Universal codes)</p>
				<p>Step 3 - The sender is taken to the PayPal site where they enter their password.</p>
				<p>Step 4 - The sender confirms payment.</p>
				<p>Step 5 - The recipient gets the money.</p>
				<h3>How can I check I've been paid?</h3>
				<p>All payments are made via PayPal so you can use any method you normally use to check your PayPal account</p>
				<h3>Is this secure?</h3>
				<p>PayPal provide all of the necessary security to ensure your payment is in place. We <b>never</b> ask for your PayPal password and so we can not access your account.</p>
				<h3>So whats in it for me?</h3>
				<p>You can make and receive payments in seconds and even include  PortaPayments codes on invoices and marketing if you want.</p>
				<h3>So whats in it for you?</h3>
				<p>We get paid either via in-app advertising or via the  percentage of the transaction we take depending on which type of code you use.</p>
