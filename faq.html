			<p>PortaPayments is a "Scan & Pay" solution which allows customers to purchase your goods by scanning a QR code with their 'phone.</p>

				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p>PortaPayments allows you to generate a bar code which can be scanned by a mobile 'phone application in order to make the payment. The payment is made in 5 easy steps;</p>
				<p>Step 1 - The payment recipient generates a payment code via this website.</p>
				<p>Step 2 - The payment sender scans the payment code using any QR code scanner.</p>
				<p>Step 3 - The sender is taken to the PayPal site where they enter their password.</p>
				<p>Step 4 - The sender confirms payment.</p>
				<p>Step 5 - The recipient gets the money.</p>
				<h3>How can I check I've been paid?</h3>
				<p>All payments are made via PayPal so you can use any method you normally use to check your PayPal account</p>
				<h3>Is this secure?</h3>
				<p>PayPal provide all of the necessary security to ensure your payment is in place. We <b>never</b> ask for your PayPal password and so we can not access your account.</p>
				<h3>So whats in it for me?</h3>
				<p>You can make and receive payments in seconds and even include  PortaPayments codes on invoices and marketing if you want.</p>
				<h3>So whats in it for you?</h3>
				<p>We take a small amount from the transaction (a quarter of one percent, or 10 minor currency units, whichever is the greater)</p>
